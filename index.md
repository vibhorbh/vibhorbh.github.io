## CPSC Lab 120 2023

*lab-6 part-2
My most favorite program out of all the ones we have practiced during this semester is lab-6 part-2. I find it amusing because it was the program that gave us an early peek into the blackjack program and helped me become more comfortable using if-else statements. I also like it because I enjoy playing blackjack every now and then.

*lab-8 part-1

lab-8 part-1 is one of my favorite programs because I was able to learn how to use command line arguments and put them to use all the previous knowledge that I gained by working on all the previous lab assignments. Its also one of my favorites because well I find the sandwish inputs interesting and funny at the same time.

*lab-9 part-2

lab-9 part-2 was a personal favorite to me because, I had been curious for some time about the working of the compare functions. This program was the first time where I actually felt that the compare function needed to be applied to compare the 2 schedules and find the smaller one of the both. Its also a favorite because it uses 2 of my favorite functions i.e., if-statements and user input functions (cin).
